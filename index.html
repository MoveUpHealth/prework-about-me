      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>As a small business owner of a specialty fitness provider, I work diligently to improve all areas 
         of our operations, including the digital side of things. I am looking forward to growing my skillset in this coding bootcamp
         and strengthening my contribution to the company.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I live in Sacramento, and have spent all of my adult life here. Though I was born in California,
         I spent most of my childhood in Aurora, Colorado, a less infamous place at the time.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Hiking and rockclimbing are two of my favorite hobbies. I'm also happy to curl up with a good book, though I find that I'm pickier 
        about my selection. I used to enjoy fantasy, specifically the Eddings and their series revolving around Belgarath. Lately, I have enjoyed historical fiction
        like, All the Light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr. Any recommendations?
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>When I was in college, I struggled to pick a major because I have a wide range of interests. 
        <br><br>Have you seen the TV show, The Pretender?<br><br>
        It's about this genius kid who was raised in a lab and trained for a purpose that I no longer recall. He escapes as an adult, and 
        while running from whoever is chasing him, takes on a wide variety of jobs to help the random people he encounters. If they 
        had offered a similar in major, I would not have struggled to make a decision. <br><br>
        That being said, running a business has allowed me to wear several hats, presenting me with a wide range of challenges that 
        constantly challenge me to learn new skills and grow as a professional. <br><br>As a bonus, the experience has made me a better person and continues to push me to improve.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In the City of Trees and America's Farm-to-Fork capital.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I believe the skills I gain as a web developer will help push my company to the next level, allowing us to provide cutting-edge services within the fitness industry.</p>
